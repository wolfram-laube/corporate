Insolvency Proceedings GZ 17 S 35/25 s, Regional Court Ried im Innkreis

\begin{center}\rule{0.5\linewidth}{0.5pt}\end{center}

Dear Ms.~Mag.a Oberndorfer,\\
Dear Mr.~Mag. Zellinger,

In connection with the above-referenced insolvency proceedings, I am
writing to request your approval for a planned employment activity,
which I would like to present to you transparently below.

\hypertarget{background}{%
\subsection{1. Background}\label{background}}

Due to the closure of my sole proprietorship Blauweiss EDV e.U.,
self-employment is currently not possible for me. However, as an IT
specialist with over 25 years of professional experience in software
architecture, cloud infrastructure, and DevOps, I possess in-demand
qualifications that I would like to utilize for the purpose of
generating income.

\hypertarget{planned-activity}{%
\subsection{2. Planned Activity}\label{planned-activity}}

I have the opportunity to work as an Independent Contractor for a
US-based company:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Company:} Blauweiss-EDV LLC
\item
  \textbf{Registered Office:} Texas, USA
\item
  \textbf{Registration:} Texas Secretary of State, File Number 806293404
\item
  \textbf{Members:} Michael Clement Matejka, Ian Bennett Matejka (both
  US citizens)
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{clarification-regarding-ownership-structure}{%
\subsection{3. Clarification Regarding Ownership
Structure}\label{clarification-regarding-ownership-structure}}

I wish to expressly emphasize that I \textbf{hold no ownership interest
in the aforementioned company and will not acquire any ownership
interest during the duration of the insolvency proceedings}. The members
are long-standing acquaintances who are willing to engage me as an
external service provider.

My role is strictly limited to the provision of IT services in exchange
for compensation within the framework of a contractor relationship.

\hypertarget{compensation-and-standard-of-living}{%
\subsection{4. Compensation and Standard of
Living}\label{compensation-and-standard-of-living}}

The compensation from this activity will be structured to enable a
modest standard of living, as is appropriate during insolvency
proceedings. I am aware that excess income would need to be contributed
to the insolvency estate, and I commit to complete transparency toward
the insolvency administration.

The specific amount of monthly disbursement can be determined in
coordination with you.

\hypertarget{transparency-and-documentation}{%
\subsection{5. Transparency and
Documentation}\label{transparency-and-documentation}}

I am prepared to provide you with all relevant documents, in particular:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The Contractor Agreement between myself and Blauweiss-EDV LLC
\item
  The Operating Agreement of the LLC (as proof of my non-ownership)
\item
  Monthly statements and payment receipts
\item
  Any other documentation you may require
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{application}{%
\subsection{6. Application}\label{application}}

I hereby apply for your approval to commence the described activity as
an IT contractor for Blauweiss-EDV LLC. I am available for any questions
and would be happy to discuss the details in a personal meeting.

Sincerely,
