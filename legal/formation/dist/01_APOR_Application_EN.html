<p><strong>Subject: Application for Approval of Employment as IT Service Provider</strong></p>
<p>Insolvency Proceedings GZ 17 S 35/25 s, Regional Court Ried im Innkreis</p>
<hr />
<p>Dear Ms. Mag.a Oberndorfer,<br />
Dear Mr. Mag. Zellinger,</p>
<p>In connection with the above-referenced insolvency proceedings, I am writing to request your approval for a planned employment activity, which I would like to present to you transparently below.</p>
<h2 id="background">1. Background</h2>
<p>Due to the closure of my sole proprietorship Blauweiss EDV e.U., self-employment is currently not possible for me. However, as an IT specialist with over 25 years of professional experience in software architecture, cloud infrastructure, and DevOps, I possess in-demand qualifications that I would like to utilize for the purpose of generating income.</p>
<h2 id="planned-activity">2. Planned Activity</h2>
<p>I have the opportunity to work as an Independent Contractor for a US-based company:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Company:</strong> Blauweiss-EDV LLC</li>
<li><strong>Registered Office:</strong> Texas, USA</li>
<li><strong>Registration:</strong> Texas Secretary of State, File Number 806293404</li>
<li><strong>Members:</strong> Michael Clement Matejka, Ian Bennett Matejka (both US citizens)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="clarification-regarding-ownership-structure">3. Clarification Regarding Ownership Structure</h2>
<p>I wish to expressly emphasize that I <strong>hold no ownership interest in the aforementioned company and will not acquire any ownership interest during the duration of the insolvency proceedings</strong>. The members are long-standing acquaintances who are willing to engage me as an external service provider.</p>
<p>My role is strictly limited to the provision of IT services in exchange for compensation within the framework of a contractor relationship.</p>
<h2 id="compensation-and-standard-of-living">4. Compensation and Standard of Living</h2>
<p>The compensation from this activity will be structured to enable a modest standard of living, as is appropriate during insolvency proceedings. I am aware that excess income would need to be contributed to the insolvency estate, and I commit to complete transparency toward the insolvency administration.</p>
<p>The specific amount of monthly disbursement can be determined in coordination with you.</p>
<h2 id="transparency-and-documentation">5. Transparency and Documentation</h2>
<p>I am prepared to provide you with all relevant documents, in particular:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Contractor Agreement between myself and Blauweiss-EDV LLC</li>
<li>The Operating Agreement of the LLC (as proof of my non-ownership)</li>
<li>Monthly statements and payment receipts</li>
<li>Any other documentation you may require</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="application">6. Application</h2>
<p>I hereby apply for your approval to commence the described activity as an IT contractor for Blauweiss-EDV LLC. I am available for any questions and would be happy to discuss the details in a personal meeting.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<hr />
<p>Wolfram Laube</p>
